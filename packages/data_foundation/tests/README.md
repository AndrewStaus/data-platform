# tests/

Unit tests for the code location.  These tests provide a way for developers to quickly
check their work and validate that they have introduced breaking changes so that they
can deploy with confidence.

## Usage

The built in testing vs code testing extension should automatically detect tests and
provide a gui to run them.  Tests can also be run through the `unittest` cli command.
