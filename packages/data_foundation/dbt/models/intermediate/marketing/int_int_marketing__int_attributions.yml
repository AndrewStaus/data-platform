        description: |-
          Represents an individual as understood by the system of record as of the
          time the interaction with the individual took place.  This is used in conjunction
          with an individual_id to connect across multiple systems to understand
          a single entity.

          Records from separate systems should use the non-unique party key to join to the
          individual entity table, and then be aggregated to on the entity id to understand
          interactions of the same customer.

          *Example*:
          ``` sql
          select
              e.individual_id,
              sum(t.revenue) revenue,
              count(distinct visit_id) visits 

          from transactions t
          left join individual_entity e
              on t.individual_party_key = e.individual_party_key
          left join site_visits v
              on v.individual_party_key = e.individual_party_key
          group by e.individual_entity_id

      be used in fine scoped attribution models with end dates.
