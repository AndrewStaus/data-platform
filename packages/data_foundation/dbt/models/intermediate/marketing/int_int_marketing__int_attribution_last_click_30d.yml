          Represents an individual as understood by the entity resolution system.
          A single individual will have multiple party keys, however they will all resolve to the
          same entity id.

          *Example*:
          ``` sql
          select
              e.individual_id,
              sum(t.revenue) revenue,
              count(distinct visit_id) visits 

          from transactions t
          left join individual_entity e
              on t.individual_party_key = e.individual_party_key
          left join site_visits v
              on v.individual_party_key = e.individual_party_key
          group by e.individual_entity_id
